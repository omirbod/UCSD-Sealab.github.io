  <h1>Getting Started: Software</h1>

  <p>The software subsystem deals with all aspects of the control of the Stingray, including vision, navigation, path planning, pose estimation.</p>


<h2>Robot Operating System (ROS)</h2>

<p>The basis for all of the Stingray's software is the <a href="http://www.ros.org" target="_blank">Robot Operating System (ROS)</a>. ROS is a platform that is widely used in the robotics and research community. ROS provides drivers for many off-the-shelf components and sensors, package management systems, visualization software, libraries for path planning, computer vision, and more, and many other features that are essential for robot software.</p>

<h3>1. Install Ubuntu</h3>
<p>ROS runs on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu Linux</a>. To work on the software, you'll need to install Linux on your computer. A good way to do this is to use a virtual machine. <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> is free software that will allow you to create virtual machines on Windows or Mac OS X. Other (not free) options are <a href="http://www.parallels.com" target="_blank">Parallels</a> (for Mac) and <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/" target="_blank">VMware Fusion</a>.</p>

<h3>2. Install ROS</h3>
<p>Once you have a working copy of Ubuntu, you can <a href="">install ROS</a>. The most current version of ROS is ROS hydro, but currently the Stingray's software is in ROS Groovy [are we switching? decide on this -- which to install!].</a></p>

<h3>3. Go through ROS Tutorials</h3>
<p>ROS supports C++, Python, and Lisp. We develop our software primarily in C++ and Python.  Once you have ROS installed, work through the <a href="" target="_blank">ROS tutorials</a> in your language of choice to get familiar with ROS.</p>


<h2>Github</h2>

<p>Github is a website interface for the powerful version control system <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>. Git manages your source code by storing a snapshot of your code base every time you commit to the remote repository. These snapshots keep track of all the revisions made to the software in the development cycle. Git also allows many developers to work on the same code, without having to be in the same place.</p>

<h3>4. Sign up for Github</h3>
<p>Create a Github account and username at <a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank">Github.com</a>. Email your username to Perry or Antonella so they can add you to the <a href="http://www.github.com/UCSD-E4E" target="_blank">UCSD E4E Organization</a> so you can start working on the software.</p>

<h3>5. Work through the Github tutorials</h3>
<p>Get familiar with Git and Github by reading about <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">Git Basics</a> and working through the <a href="www.github.com/" target="_blank">Github tutorials</a>.</p>


<h2>Stingray Software</h2>

<h3>6. Familiarize yourself with the existing software</h3>

<h4>Stereo Vision and 3D Reconstruction Software</h4>
<p>Right now our 3D reconstruction software is located on Github in the <a href="http://www.github.com/UCSD-Sealab/3Dreconstruction" target="_blank">UCSD-Sealab/3Dreconstruction</a> repository. Clone this repository and look through the code to get familiar with what's in there. Then read through the <a href="documentation.html">documentation</a>.</p>


<h4>Path Planning and Navigation</h4>
<p></p>


<h4>Controls</h4>
<p></p>


<h4>Visual Pose Estimation and SLAM</h4>
<p></p>


<h2>Literature Review</h2>

<h3>7. Read up on the beginning literature for your software subsystem</h3>
